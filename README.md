# React useEffect Hook Missing Dependency
This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook: a missing dependency that leads to unexpected behavior and potential bugs. The issue arises when the conditional logic within the `useEffect` function relies on values that are not included in the dependency array.

## Bug Description
The `useEffect` hook's dependency array determines when the effect function runs. In the example provided, the effect function's behavior depends on the `count` variable, particularly the condition `count > 0`.  However, the dependency array only includes `count`.  This means that the condition is evaluated only when `count` changes. If any other state or prop is involved in the logic but missing from the dependency array, the behavior may be erratic, especially with asynchronous operations.

## Solution
To fix this, ensure that all values used within the effect function (including those involved in conditional logic) are added to the dependency array. This guarantees that the effect re-runs whenever those values change.
